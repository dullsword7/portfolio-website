                I graduated from the Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.
                While I was there I took a large mixture of projects courses involving artificial intelligence, game development and web development.
                I was also employed by the Ohio State College of Optometry to develop experimental training software in VR.
